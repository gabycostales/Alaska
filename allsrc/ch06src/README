This directory contains the source code for the Game Server from chapter 6 of the book.

A few notes:
- don't put this code in a dir with spaces in the pathname. eg: on windows put it in "c:\javagamebook", not "c:\Documents and Settings\"
- when connecting to the server on the same machine as the client, you must use the machine's actual IP address, not "localhost" or the loopback address (127.0.0.1)

To build:

$ ant

To run:

Use the shell scripts in the bin dir, eg:

./bin/server.sh

./bin/client.sh <server_ip> <username>
